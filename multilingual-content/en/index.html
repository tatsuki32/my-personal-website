                <h3>Lifestyle Habits</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Smoking:</strong> I do not smoke. I do smoke non-nicotine shisha, but stopped nicotine shisha when launching shisha bars as it worsened my atopic dermatitis.</li>
                    <li><strong>Alcohol:</strong> I do not drink. I used to drink when managing bars, but currently, alcohol allergy and atopic dermatitis worsen, making me itch after just one beer, so I stopped.</li>
                    <li><strong>All-nighters (playing out all night):</strong> I do not pull all-nighters. I used to enjoy them, but recently, I prioritize my morning routine, and disrupting it makes my day unstable and disorganized due to my weak willpower. While Tokyo has many places to play until morning, in Kyrgyzstan and Kazakhstan, there are only clubs, bars, and 24-hour cafes, and friends who would join me are rare, so it faded from my habits. I'm usually home by 9:00 PM.</li>
                </ul>

                <hr style="margin: 40px 0;">

                <h3>Relationship with the Internet</h3>
                <p>The concept of "slow internet" has been proposed, but I often feel tired and "don't want to do anything anymore" due to the overwhelming amount of information I receive daily, exceeding my information management and collection capacity. Also, even after summarizing and abstracting content, I sometimes can't recall details from movies or books when asked by friends. Therefore, I try to write down my impressions and critiques of web articles, books, and movies whenever I notice. This not only helps me remember good articles I've read but also allows me to understand what I felt, realized, and learned from them, serving as good practice for "thinking for myself."</p>

                <h3>Hobbies</h3>
                <p>I have many hobbies, and they change with age, but these are the things I probably won't stop until the end of my life:</p>

                <h3>Daily Routine (Including Ideal)</h3>
                <p>I wake up at 5 AM, brush my teeth, wash my face, style my hair, shave, do skincare, and drink water. Then, while listening to music, I grind coffee beans. I meditate for 5 minutes, visualize for 10 minutes, do affirmations for 1 minute, and journal for 10 minutes. After that, I stretch for 20 minutes, then study languages for 30 minutes. If my shoulders get tired, I take a walk or stretch and read 10 pages of a book. Afterward, I make a light breakfast and start work. Work involves doing something beneficial for others. I start at 7:00 AM and continue until 10:00 AM. After that, it varies by day, but most of my decision-making requiring mental effort is completed during the morning. I then go outside to relax. In the evening, I return home by 9:00 PM and turn off the lights by 10:00 PM. On nights when I can't sleep, I allow myself to stay awake but always make sure to wake up by 5 AM.</p>

                <h3>Supplement (My Thoughts & Values)</h3>
                <p>The following are supplementary notes on my personal thoughts and values. I hope these items provide further insight into who I am. I have used abstract language to respect personal privacy.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Interpersonal Relationships & Romance:</strong> I aspire to relationships built on mutual respect and independence, where we need each other and maintain/improve our bond through regular dialogue and discussion. I believe that worries are endless as long as we live, and I value the willingness to support each other and overcome challenges together. I also recognize that humanity can never be omniscient but remains ignorant, and I aim for a relationship where we can hold hands together even in old age.</li>
                    <li><strong>Current Relationship Status:</strong> At present, I am not interested in forming relationships with specific others using terms like "girlfriend" or "dating." Past relationships are, for convenience, treated as if they never existed. However, regarding marriage, as it involves legalities and more stakeholders, I would acknowledge the existence of a partner if I were to marry in the future.</li>
                    <li><strong>Gender:</strong> I do not intend to define my gender in a fixed way.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>Hello! My name is Tatsuki. Since childhood, I've been fascinated by the mysterious power of words, and I've been learning various languages and exploring their depths. This blog is a personal record of my language learning journey, and I started it with the desire to share the wonders of the world seen through language and the possibilities of communication with all of you.</p>
                <p>As a hobby, I'm dedicated to multilingual learning, with a particular focus on English, Russian, and Kyrgyz. I'm also interested in Classical Japanese, which appears in classical literature, and the creation of artificial languages. I believe that language is not just a series of symbols, but something that shapes culture, history, and human thought itself.</p>
                <p>I also love traveling, and the languages and people I've encountered in various countries have deepened my curiosity. Sometimes, I even consider mathematics and music as "languages," exploring their commonalities and differences. I hope this blog sparks your interest in languages and becomes a catalyst for new discoveries.</p>
                <p>Please take your time to join me on my "journey through words."</p>
